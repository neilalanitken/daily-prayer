				<p><em>Psalm</em> 104<p>
				<ol>
					<li>Bless the Lord, O my soul:<br />O Lord my God, how great you are.</li>
					<br />
					<li>Clothed with majesty and honour:<br />wrapped in light as a garment.</li>
					<br />
					<li>You make the winds your messengers:<br />and flames of fire your ministers.</li>
					<br />
					<li>Lord, how various are your works:<br />
						in wisdom you have made them all, and the earth is full of<br />your creatures.</li>
					<br />
					<li>When you send forth your spirit they are created:<br />and you renew the face of the earth.</li>
					<br />
					<li>May the glory of the Lord endure forever:<br />may the Lord rejoice in his works.</li>
					<br />
					<li class="glory">Glory to the Father...</li>
				</ol>
				<br />
				<p>The God of out fathers raised Jesus whom you killed by hanging<br />
					him on a tree. God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and<br />
					Saviour, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. And we<br />
					are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God<br />
					has given to those who obey Him. (Acts 5.30-32)</p>
