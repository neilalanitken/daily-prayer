			<ol>
				<li>Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel:<br />
					for he has come to his people and set them free.</li>
				<br />
				<li>He has raised up for us a mighty saviour:<br />
					born of the house of his servant David.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Through his holy prophets he promised of old:<br />
					that he would save us from our enemies,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the hands of all that hate us.</li>
				<br />
				<li>He promised to show mercy to our fathers:<br />
					and to remember his holy covenant.</li>
				<br />
				<li>This was the oath he swore to our father Abraham:<br />
					to set us free from the hands of our enemies.</li>
				<br />
				<li>free to worship him without fear:<br />
					holy and righteous in his sight all the days of our life.</li>
				<br />
				<li>You my child shall be called the prophet of the most high:<br />
					for you will go before the Lord to prepare his way.</li>
				<br />
				<li>to give his people knowledge of salvation:<br />
					by the forgiveness of all their sins.</li>
				<br />
				<li>In the tender compassion of our God:<br />
					the dawn from on high shall break upon us.</li>
				<br />
				<li>to shine on those who dwell in darkness<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the shadow of death:<br />
					and to guide our feet into the way of peace.</li>
				<br />
				<li class="glory">Glory to the Father...</li>
