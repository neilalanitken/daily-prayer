				<p><strong>Lent (Returning to God)</strong></p>
				<p><em>Psalm 51</em></p>
				<ol>
					<li>Have mercy on me, O God, in your enduring goodness:<br />according to the fulness of your compassion<br />
					blot out my offences.</li>
					<br />
					<li>Wash me thoroughly from my wickedness:<br />and cleanse me from my sin<br />
					<br />
					<li>For I acknowledge my rebellion:<br />and my sin is ever before me.</li>
					<br />
					<li>Create in me a clean heart, O God:<br />and renew a right spirit within me.</li>
					<br />
					<li>Do not cast me out from your presence:<br />do not take your holy spirit from me.</li>
					<br />
					<li>O give me the gladness of your help again:<br />and support me with a willing spirit.</li>
					<br />
					<li>The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit:<br />
					a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.</li>
					<br />
					<li class="glory">Glory to the Father...</li>
				</ol>
				<br />
				<p id="reading">Finally, brethren, we beseech and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that<br />
					as you learned from us how you ought to live and to please God, just<br />
					as you are doing, you do so more and more. For God has not called<br />
					us for uncleanliness, but in holiness. (1 Thess 4. 1, 7)</p>
