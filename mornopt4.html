			<p>Option 4. &nbsp; <em>Psalm</em> 145</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom:<br />
					and your dominion endures through all generations.</li>
				<br />
				<li>The Lord upholds all those who stumble:<br />
					and raises up those that are bowed down.</li>
				<br />
				<li>The eyes of all look to you in hope:<br />
					and you give them their food in due season;</li>
				<br />
				<li>You open wide your hand:<br />
					and fill all things living with your bounteous gift.</li>
				<br />
				<li>The Lord is just in all his ways:<br />
					and faithful in all his dealings.</li>
				<br />
				<li>The Lord is near to all who call upon him:<br />
					to all who call upon him in truth.</li>
				<br />

			<p id="reading">Come, let us return to the Lord; for he has torn us and will heal us, he<br />
							has struck us and he will bind up our wounds; after two days he will<br />
							revive us, on the third day he will restore us, that in his presence we<br />
							may live. Let us humble ourselves, let us strive to know the Lord,<br />
							whose justice dawns like morning light, and its dawning is as sure as<br />
							the sunrise. It will come to us like a shower, like spring rains that water<br />
							the earth. (Hosea 6.1-3)</p>
