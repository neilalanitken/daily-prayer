			<p><em>Psalm</em> 150</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Praise the Lord, O praise God in his sanctuary:<br />praise him in the firmament of his power.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Praise him for his mighty acts:<br />praise him according to his abundant goodness.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Praise him in the blast of the ram's horn:<br />praise him upon the lute and harp.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Praise him with the timbrel and dances:<br />praise him upon the strings and pipe.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Praise him on the high-sounding cymbals:<br />praise him on the loud cymbals.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Let everything that has breath praise the Lord:<br />O praise the Lord!</li>
				<br />
				<li class="glory">Glory to the Father...</li>

			<p id="reading">God raised Jesus on the third day and made him manifest; not to all<br />
				the people but to those of us who were chosen by God as witnesses, who ate<br />
				and drank with him after he rose from the dead. (Acts 10.40-41)</p>
