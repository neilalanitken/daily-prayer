			<ol>
				<li>Give judgement for me O God,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;take up my cause against an ungodly people:<br />deliver me from deceiful and wicked men.</li>
				<br />
				<li>For you are God my refuge, why have you turned me away:<br />why must I go like a mourner because the enemy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;oppresses me?</li>
				<br />
				<li>O send out your light and your truth and let them lead me:<br />let them guide me to your holy hill and to your dwelling.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Then I shall go to the altar of God,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to God my joy and my delight:<br />and to the harp I shall sing your praises O God my God.</li>
				<br />
				<li>Why are you so full of heaviness my soul:<br />and why so unquiet within me?</li>
				<br />
				<li>O put your trust in God:<br />for I will praise him yet who is my deliverance and my God.</li>
				<br />
				<li class="glory">Glory to the Father...</li>

			<p>The Lord's true love is surely not spent, nor has his compassion<br />failed; they are new every morning, so great is his constancy. The<br />Lord, I say, is all that I have; therefore I will wait for him patiently.<br />The Lord is good to those who look for him, to all who seek him.<br />(Lam. 3.22-25)</p>
