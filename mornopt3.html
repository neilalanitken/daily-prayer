			<p>Option 3. &nbsp; <em>Psalm</em> 63</p>
			<ol>
				<li>God you are my God:<br />
					eagerly will I seek you.</li>
				<br />
				<li>My soul thirsts for you, my flesh longs for you:<br />
					as a dry and thirsty land where no water is.</li>
				<br />
				<li>So it was when I beheld you in the sanctuary:<br />
					and saw your power and your glory.</li>
				<br />
				<li>For your unchanging goodness is better than life:<br />
					therefore my lips shall praise you.</li>
				<br />
				<li>And so I will bless you as long as I live:<br />
					and in your name will I lift my hands on high.</li>
				<br />
				<li>My longing shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness:<br />
					my mouth shall praise you with exultant lips.</li>
				<br />
				<li class="glory">Glory to the Father...</li>

			<p id="reading">Live like those who are at home in daylight, for where light is, there all<br />
							goodness springs up, all justice and truth. Everything, when once the<br />
							light has shown it up, is illumined, and everything thus illumined is all<br />
							light. And so the hymn says: ‘Awake, sleeper, rise from the dead, and<br />
							Christ will shine upon you.’ (Ephesians 5.9,13,14)</p>
