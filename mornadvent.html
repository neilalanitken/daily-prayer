				<p><strong>Advent (Anticipation)</strong></p>
				</p><em>Psalm 97</em></p>
				<ol>
					<li>The Lord Is King; let the earth rejoice:<br />let the multitude of islands be glad.</li>
					<br />
					<li>Clouds and Darkness are round him;<br />
					righteousness and justice are the foundations of his throne.</li>
					<br />
					<li>For you, Lord, are the most high over all the earth:<br />you are exalted far above all gods.</li>
					<br />
					<li>The Lord loves those that hate evil:<br />the Lord guards the life of the faithful, and delivers them
					<br /> from the hands of the ungodly.</li>
					<br />
					<li>Light dawns for the righteous:<br />and joy for the true of heart.</li>
					<br />
					<li>Rejoice in the Lord, you righteous:<br /> and give thanks to his holy name.</li>
					<br />
					<li class="glory">Glory to the Father...</li>					
				</ol>
				<br />
				<p id="reading">Besides this you know what hour it is, how it is full time now for you<br />
					to wake from sleep. For Salvation is nearer to us now than when we<br />
					first believed. (Rom. 13.11-12)</p>
