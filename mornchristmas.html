				<p><em>Psalm 98</em></p>
				<ol>
					<li>O Sing to the Lord a new song:<br />for he has done marvellous things.</li>
					<br />
					<li>his right hand and his holy arm:<br />they have got him the victory.</li>
					<br />
					<li>The Lord has made known his salvation:<br />
						he has revealed his just deliverance in the sight of all the<br />nations.</li>
					<br />
					<li>He has remembered his mercy and faithfulness<br />towards the house of Israel:<br />
						and all the ends of the earth have seen<br />the salvation of our God.</li>
					<br />
					<li>Shout with joy to the Lord, all the earth:<br />break into singing and make melody.</li>
					<br />
					<li>For he has come to judge the earth:<br />he shall judge the world with righteousness,<br />
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the peoples with equity.</li>
					<br />
					<li class="glory">Glory to the Father...</li>

				<p id="reading">In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the<br />
				prophets; but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom<br />
				he has appointed the heir of all things, through whom he has also<br />
				created the world. (Heb. 1.1-2)</p>
